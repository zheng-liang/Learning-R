# 1 Introduction

The purpose of this project is to introduce time series modelling and forecasting in R using a practical example. It covers the common tests that are done in time series analysis, such as unit root tests for stationarity, Breusch-Godfrey test for serial correlation, and Granger Causality test for determining relationship between variables.

The data used in this project was obtained from the Department of Statistics Singapore and can be accessed from the [SingStat Table Builder](https://tablebuilder.singstat.gov.sg/).
