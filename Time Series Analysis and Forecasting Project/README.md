## What is this project about?

Through this project, I attempted to apply what I had learnt about time series models and forecasting 
during my undergraduate course using R.  

The project uses ARIMA, ARDL and VAR models to forecast Singapore's Consumer Price Index using data
from previous periods and with other variables, namely the Domestic Supply Price Index and the Composite Leading 
Index of Singapore.  

I wanted to do this project to find out if R was suitable for time series analysis, as compared to Stata or EViews,
which I had used during my undergraduate coursework. It was not as simple and straightforward as these softwares, and the
disadvantages have been highlighted in my discussion.
