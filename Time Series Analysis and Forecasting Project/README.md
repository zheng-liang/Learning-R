## Project Description

### 1 Forecasting Singapore CPI Using Different Time Series Models

Through this project, I attempted to apply what I had learnt about time series models and forecasting 
during my undergraduate course using R.  

The project uses ARIMA, ARDL and VAR models to forecast Singapore's Consumer Price Index using data
from previous periods and with other variables, namely the Domestic Supply Price Index and the Composite Leading 
Index of Singapore.  

I wanted to do this project to find out if R was suitable for time series analysis, as compared to Stata or EViews,
which I had used during my undergraduate coursework. It was not as simple and straightforward as these softwares, and the
disadvantages have been highlighted in my discussion.

### 2 Effects of Bond Yields, VIX and Initial Jobless Claims on S&P 500

The aim of this project was to study the combined effects of the 10Y/2Y Treasury Yield Spread, the CBOE Volatility Index,
and the U.S. Initial Jobless Claims on the S&P 500, measured by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF closing price. An Autoregressive
Distributed Lags model was used to estimate the SPY returns and forecast for the 4 weeks in June 2022.
