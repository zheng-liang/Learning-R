## What is this project about?

The purpose of this project is to introduce logistic regression in R and how to apply it in binary classification problems.
I have split the project into two core projects.  

### 1. Binary Classification Using Logistic Regression Models

The first project of the Classification Using Logistic Regression Models Project has 4 main parts. The first part introduces 
logistic regression and the assumptions of logistic regression. The second part shows how logistic regression is applied in 
binary classification problems using a data set in the `mlbench` package called `PimaIndiansDiabetes`. The third part introduces the
Receiver Operating Characteristic and Precision-Recall curves to decide on an appropriate probability threshold. The final part shows common
methods of dealing with imbalanced data sets.

### 2. A More Comprehensive Application to Binary Classification Using Logistic Regression

The second project uses the [`Default of Credit Card Clients`](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients)
data set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It is a highly imbalanced data set and has many variables (up to 23, excluding the class
variable to predict). This would help me to learn more about feature/variable selection either by creating new variables or using techniques
such as stepwise or LASSO regression. It will also determine if the methods used for dealing with imbalanced data sets are robust enough
when using the models for out-of-sample prediction.
