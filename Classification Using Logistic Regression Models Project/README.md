## What is this project about? (WIP)

The purpose of this project is to introduce logistic regression in R and how to apply it in binary classification problems.  

The first part introduces logistic regression and the assumptions of logistic regression.  

The second part shows how logistic regression is applied in binary classification problems using a dataset in one of the R packages.

The third and final part applies binary logistic regression on an external dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository with more practical approaches,
such as using the Receiver Operating Curve to determine the cut-off probability. The evaluation of the models' performance is done on in-sample and out-of-sample data.
