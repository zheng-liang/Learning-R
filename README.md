# What is Learning-R?
This repository contains projects that documents what I have learnt in R and is not intended to be an advanced guide to using R in any particular field.  
The purpose was to show how R can be used in different fields, such as portfolio optimization, machine learning and econometric modelling.  
Each folder contains a different type of project and more sub-folders may be added in due time.  

# What is in each folder?
Each folder contains a few things.  
- Files beginning with MD: Markdown files that can be rendered in github
- Files beginning with RMD: R markdown files that will not be rendered in github
- Files beginning with Script: Contains all the codes used in the RMD
- README: Gives an overview of the project and the content in the MD
