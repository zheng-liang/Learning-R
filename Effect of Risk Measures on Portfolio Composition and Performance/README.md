## Description of Project

In this project, I attempted to determine the effects of the different risk measures on portfolio optimization and performance.
The following risk measures have been used:  

1. Variance and Standard Deviation
2. Semi-Variance and Semi-Deviation
3. Downside Deviation
4. Value-at-Risk
5. Conditional Value-at-Risk (or Expected Shortfall, Expected Tail Loss)

In the first part, I introduced the different measures on a single security and show how they differ. In the second part, I generated
random portfolios and optimized two sets of portfolios:  

- Portfolios that minimize the different risk measures
- Portfolios that minimize the different risk measures for a given level of return

The portfolio was created using 10 large-cap U.S. equities, and benchmarked against the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY).
