# Project Description

The purpose of this project was to apply what I had learnt in R onto portfolio optimization.  

The first part introduces the relevant packages and functions in R, which includes importing stock price data from Yahoo Finance, 
calculating returns and important evaluation metrics.  

The second part involves single-period optimization and periodic optimization and back-testing.
For the single-period optimization, I created one portfolio that minimizes variance and another that maximizes returns.
For the back-testing optimization, I used the mean-variance portfolio, and solved the optimization using the random
portfolio method.
