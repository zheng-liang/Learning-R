## Project Description

### 1 Portfolio Optimization and Back-testing

The purpose of this project was to apply what I had learnt in R onto portfolio optimization.  

The first part introduces the relevant packages and functions in R, which includes importing stock price data from Yahoo Finance, 
calculating returns and important evaluation metrics.  

The second part involves single-period optimization and periodic optimization and back-testing.
For the single-period optimization, I created one portfolio that minimizes variance and another that maximizes returns.
For the back-testing optimization, I used the mean-variance portfolio, and solved the optimization using the random
portfolio method.

### 2 Random Selection, Expertise and Index Investing

The aim of this project is to find out if portfolios made of 15 randomly selected stocks from the S&P500 Large-Cap Index 
can outperform stock-picking experts and index investing. The portfolios were optimized based on the mean-variance framework 
developed by Harry Markowitz for simplicity, with the goal of maximizing the ex-post Sharpe Ratio during the optimization period.  

The project is meant to be a fun/thought experiment, and is not meant to disprove of index or active investing. It does not 
make use of any statistical methods to prove that random selection, expertise or index investing is a better choice.
