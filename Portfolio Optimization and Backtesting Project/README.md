# What is this project about?

The purpose of this project was to apply what I had learnt in R onto portfolio optimization.  

The first part introduces the relevant packages and functions in R, which includes importing stock price data from Yahoo Finance, 
calculating returns and important evaluation metrics.  

The second part involves single-period optimization and periodic optimization and back-testing.
