## Project Description

The purpose of this project was to learn about Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models
and how to build these models in R. I used the GARCH models (standard GARCH, GJR and EGARCH) on weekly returns of Apple
Inc. (AAPL) as an example, and did basic out-of-sample forecasting and evaluation.  

While GARCH models might not be commonly used in practical trading activity, it appears to be widely used in academic and
research papers to study the effects of volatility. There is more to improve on this project on the forecasting methods,
which I may tackle in a future project.
